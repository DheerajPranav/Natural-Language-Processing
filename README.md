Here I've used different scraping techniques to collect data , then clean it using NLTK,RE,Stop words , and applying TF-IDF , word2Vec ,Vectorization , POS Tags and apply different models. Also built as Spam classifier using Naive Bayes probabilistic Theorem, Machine Translation, Speech recognition using spectogram features and formed model using Bi directional RNN - Simple RNN - Cnn Rnn.
